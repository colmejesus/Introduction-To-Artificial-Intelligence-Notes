## ENIAC (1946): It was the first  programmable electric, general purpose computer built to compute the trajectory of projectiles fired by the enemies, which it did in 30 seconds. It was also the first computer to use binary digits (Bits) to represent data, and was capable of storing data in its memory for later use.  

## The Turing Test (1950): Alan Turing came up with the idea of the Turing Test in his 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," which was published in the academic journal 'Mind'. In the paper, Turing argued that rather than trying to define intelligence or determine whether a machine can 'truly' think, it would be more useful to consider the practical question of whether a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior that is indistinguishable from a human. He proposed the Turing Test as a way to evaluate this capability.

## Turing's paper was an important contribution to the field of A.I., as it introduced the concept of machine intelligence as something that can be evaluated through behavior. The idea of the Turing Test has since become a seminal concept in the field of AI and continues to be widely discussed and debated.

## The Dartmouth proposal (1956) : It was a seminal document written by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester and Claude Shannon and was presented at Dartmouth Conference, this document established A.I. as a distinct discipline and this conference is widely considered to be the birth of A.I. as a research field. 

## The Dartmouth proposal outlined the goal of creating machines that could perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, solving problems, and recognizing objects. The authors argued that these goals could be achieved by developing techniques for computer programming that would allow machines to learn from experience and make decisions based on incomplete information.

## ELIZA (1964): It was a computer program created by Joseph Wizenbaum in 1964, an A.I. researcher from MIT. ELIZA was designed to simulate a psychotherapist, using a series of scripts and pattern matching algorithms to respond to user inputs. The program was designed to demonstration of the idea that computers could be used to simulate human conversation. Despite its simple design, Eliza was surprisingly effective at convincing people they were talking to a real psychotherapist. This sparked a great deal of interest in the field of A.I. research and the potential for using computer to simulate human conversation. 

## Shakey (1966): Shakey was a mobile robot developed by Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in 1966, and it was one of the first robot to use A.I. techniques and was designed to demonstrate the feasibility of using robots using computers. It was controlled by a computer program that used A.I. algorithms to sensor interpret data and plan actions.

# A.I. Winters:

## The term A.I. winters refers to a period of decreased funding and interest in A.I. research. There have been two major A.I. winters, one in the 1970s and 1980s and another in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

## The first A.I. winter came in the 1970s & 80s. There was a lot of excitement and optimism about the potential of A.I. and many optimistic predictions about its future, but due to overhyped expectations and no progress in delivering on these promises, caused funding for A.I. research to decline and the field stagnated.

## The second A.I. winter came in late 1980 and early 1990s, again due to lack of progress and a decrease in funding. This time, the cause was a combination of multiple factors, including a drop in military funding for A.I. research, a general decline in the overall economy and a perception that A.I. has not lived up to its promises. 

## Both AI winters had a significant impact on the field of AI, causing a slowdown in research and development and making it difficult for AI researchers to secure funding for their work. However, the field eventually rebounded, and AI has since made significant progress and has become an increasingly important and widely used technology.

## Deep Blue Defeats Garry Kasparov-1997: Deep blue was a chess playing computer developed by IBM that made history in 1997 by becoming the first computer to defeat a reigning World Chess Champion, Garry Kasparov, in a match. The first match between them was played in February 1996, Kasparov won that match 4-2, but in May 1997, Deep Blue defeated Kasparov in a rematch with a score of 3.5-2.5. 

## This event marked a significant milestone in the development of A.I. and demonstrated the potential of computers in performing tasks that were once considered the exclusive domain of human intelligence. This match was widely covered in the media and generated significant public interest in A.I., which help spur further research in the field.  

## Remote-Agent Deep Space 1 (RA-DS1)-1999: It was an A.I. system that was developed by NASA to control a spacecraft on a deep mission. The system was tested on board the Deep Space-1 spacecraft in 1998 and was the first autonomous A.I. system to control a spacecraft in deep space. It was designed to control the spacecraft and perform tasks such as navigation, spacecraft monitoring, and make scientific observations. 

## The system used a variety of A.I. techniques, including rule-based system, decision trees, and machine learning to perform its tasks and make decisions about how to operate the spacecraft. The RA-DS1 system had a significant impact in the field of A.I. and demonstrated that A.I. systems had the potential to control a complex system and make real-world decisions in a real world, high-stakes environment.
