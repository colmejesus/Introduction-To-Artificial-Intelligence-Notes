## Mars Rovers 'Spirit' & 'Opportunity,'-2004/2005: These mars rovers, launched in 2003, used A.I. technology in their mission to explore the Martian terrain in 2004 & 2005. The rovers were equipped with A.I. systems that helped them navigate and make decisions autonomously on the rugged terrain of Mars.

## The A.I. systems used in the Mars rovers were based on techniques such as computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning. These techniques have since then been further developed and have been applied to a wide range of domains, including self-driving cars, robotics, and space exploration.

## DARPA Grand Challenge-2005: The DARPA was a series of autonomous vehicle competitions organized by the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), a research agency of The United States Department Of Defense. The first Grand Challenge event took place in 2003, and subsequent events we help in 2005-2007. 

## The Grand Challenge was organized to advance the development and research of autonomous vehicle technology and to encourage innovation in the field. The competition required teams to build autonomous vehicles that could complete a set course in the shortest amount of time possible, the set course was designed to be challenging and tested the capabilities of the vehicle in a variety of scenarios. 

## The first challenge was won by a Team from Stanford University, who built a vehicle Stanley that completed the course in 7 hours. The DARPA Grand Challenge was a major milestone in the history of autonomous vehicle technology.

## IBM Watson Wins Jepordy-2011: WATSON was a cognitive computing system developed in 2011, IBM WATSON participated in a widely-publicized game of Jeopardy against two of the show's most successful human champions. Watson won the game, demonstrating the ability to understand natural language questions and provide accurate answers in real-time. 

## The game has a huge impact on the field of A.I. and cognitive computing. It demonstrated the potential of A.I. to perform task that were previously considered the exclusive domain of human intelligence, such as understanding and processing natural language. The game also helped raise public awareness about A.I. and encouraged further research in the field.
