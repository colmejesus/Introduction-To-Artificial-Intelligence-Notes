### Cognitive tasks involve activities that require processing information and making decisions based on that information. Any task that is involved with reasoning, applying logic, problem-solving and by using their perception of the situation to perform a specific task, can be defined as a cognitive task. 

## There are three kinds of Cognitive Tasks:

### Formal Cognitive Tasks: These kinds of tasks are structured, standardized that are designed to assess specific cognitive abilities or mental process. They typically have well-defined rules, procedures, and outcomes, and are used to measure the performance of individuals in a controlled and objective manner, for e.g. Games like Chess, Checkers or mathematical tasks that involve Logic, Geometry, Calculus, Proving a theorem etc.

### Expert Cognitive Tasks: These are the tasks that require advanced level of knowledge, experience or skill in a particular domain These tasks typically involve sophisticated problem-solving, critical thinking and decision-making skills and are used to access the cognitive abilities of individuals who are an expert in their fields for e.g. Medical Diagnosis, Stock Market Prediction, Design, Fault Finding etc. 

### Perceptual Cognitive Tasks: These are the tasks that require one to process sensory information from the environment, such as visual, auditory and somatosensory stimuli. These take assess an individual's ability to perceive, analyze and interpret sensory information and involve processes like attention, perception, discrimination and memory. For example, understanding natural language, vision, speech etc. 

## What is artificial intelligence (Algorithmic view): AI develops a set of tools, heuristics (any approach to problem-solving or self discovery that employs a practical method not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, or rational, but is nevertheless sufficient for reaching an immediate, short-term goal or approximation) that lets a user solve NP-hard problems for naturally occurring instances for e.g. Game playing, search, planning etc. 

## What are NP-hard problems?

### NP problems are computational problems that are considered to be the hardest problems to solve. NP-hard stands for 'Non-deterministic Polynomial-time hard'. NP problems are characterized by the fact that no efficient (i.e. polynomial-time) algorithm exists for finding a solution. Instead, these problems can only be solved using an algorithm that run in exponential time, i.e. the time it takes to solve a problem grows as the problem grows in time. An example is NP-hard problems is, the traveling salesman problem, where the goal is to find the shortest route that visits a set of cities and returns to the starting city, in this problem finding the shortest route gets more and more difficult as the distance between cities increases.



## What is P vs NP Problem?

### P versus NP is one of the most important open problems in computer science and mathematics. It asks whether every problem for which a solution can be verified quickly can also be solved quickly.

### In computational terms, a problem is said to be in P (polynomial time) if there exists an algorithm that can solve the problem in time that grows as a polynomial function of the size of the problem. For example, if the size of the problem is represented by a variable "n", an algorithm that solves a problem in time T(n) = n^2 would be considered to be in P.

### A problem is said to be in NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) if a solution to the problem can be verified quickly. In other words, given a solution, it is possible to check whether it is a correct solution in time that grows as a polynomial function of the size of the problem.

### The question of whether P equals NP asks whether every problem in NP can also be solved in P. In other words, it asks whether there exists an algorithm that can solve all problems in NP as quickly as easy problems can be solved.

### If P does equal NP, this would have far-reaching consequences for fields such as cryptography and optimization, as it would mean that many problems that are currently considered intractable can be solved quickly and efficiently. On the other hand, if P does not equal NP, this would mean that there are some problems for which no efficient solution exists.

## Weak A.I. solutions vs Strong A.I. solutions:

### Weak AI (Artificial Intelligence) solutions are designed to perform a narrow, specific task or set of tasks. They are trained using large amounts of data and algorithms to perform a specific function, such as recognizing images or translating language. These solutions are also known as narrow AI or narrow artificial intelligence.

### An example of a weak AI solution would be a spam filter for email, which is designed specifically to identify and mark unsolicited emails. Another example would be a recommendation system used by e-commerce websites, which is trained to recommend products to users based on their previous purchases and browsing history.

### On the other hand, Strong AI (Artificial General Intelligence) solutions are designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, perception, and learning. They are not limited to a specific task or set of tasks, but instead have the ability to learn and adapt to new situations, just like a human being.

### An example of a strong AI solution would be a machine that can understand and respond to natural language, such as a virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa. Another example would be a machine that can learn to play chess or Go, not just because it has been programmed to follow a set of rules, but because it has the ability to reason, strategize, and make decisions based on its experiences.

### While weak AI solutions are becoming increasingly common in various applications, strong AI solutions are still largely in the realm of research and development and are not yet widely used in practical applications.

## Logical vs Probabilistic vs Neural AI systems:

### Logical AI systems are based on mathematical logic and use rules and inference to deduce new information from known information. They work by representing knowledge in the form of logical statements and rules, and then using automated reasoning to make inferences and draw conclusions. Logical AI systems are well-suited for problems that can be clearly defined and expressed in terms of logical rules, such as decision-making and planning.

### Probabilistic AI systems, on the other hand, are based on probability theory and deal with uncertainty and incomplete information. They use statistical methods and algorithms to model and reason about uncertain events, making predictions based on probabilities. Probabilistic AI systems are particularly useful in applications such as pattern recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems, where the input data may be incomplete or ambiguous.

### Neural AI systems are based on artificial neural networks and are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are composed of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, that process and transmit information, allowing the system to learn from data and make predictions. Neural AI systems are used for a wide range of applications, including image recognition, speech recognition, and game playing.
